# R

# R for data science

While Python has been used by many programmers even before they were introduced to data science, R has its main focus on statistics, data analysis, and graphical models. R is meant mainly for data science. Just like Python, R has also has very good community support. Python is good for beginners, R is good for experienced data scientists. R provides the most comprehensive statistical analysis packages.

In this module, I will again talk about both theory as well as hands-on about various aspects of R. I will use the R Studio for hands-on. I will discuss basic programming aspects of R as well as visualization using R. Then, I will talk about how to use R for exploratory data analysis, for data wrangling, and for building models on labeled data. Overall, I will cover whatever you need to do good data science using R.
